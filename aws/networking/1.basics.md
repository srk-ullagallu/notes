### **OSI Model (7 Layers)**
1. **Physical** ‚Äì Cables, switches, routers, Wi-Fi signals.  
2. **Data Link** ‚Äì MAC addresses, Ethernet, VLANs.  
3. **Network** ‚Äì IP addressing, routing (Routers, Layer 3 switches).  
4. **Transport** ‚Äì TCP/UDP, port numbers, flow control.  
5. **Session** ‚Äì Establishing/closing connections (e.g., NetBIOS, RPC).  
6. **Presentation** ‚Äì Data encryption, compression (SSL, JPEG, ASCII).  
7. **Application** ‚Äì End-user services (HTTP, DNS, SMTP, SSH).  

### **TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)**
1. **Network Access (Link)** ‚Äì Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC addresses.  
2. **Internet** ‚Äì IP, ICMP, ARP, routing between networks.  
3. **Transport** ‚Äì TCP (reliable) & UDP (fast, no guarantee).  
4. **Application** ‚Äì HTTP, DNS, FTP, SSH, etc.  

üí° **Main Difference**:  
- OSI is theoretical (detailed structure).  
- TCP/IP is practical (real-world networking).  

üîπ **Example**: When you visit a website:  
- DNS resolves the domain (Application Layer).  
- Data is sent over TCP (Transport Layer).  
- IP addresses route packets (Internet Layer).  
- Ethernet/Wi-Fi transmits data (Network Access Layer).
---
## **IP Addressing**  
An **IP address** is a unique identifier for devices on a network. It consists of **four octets** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`), and each octet is **8 bits**, making it a **32-bit address** (IPv4).  

### **Types of IP Addresses**  
üîπ **Public IP** ‚Äì Used on the internet, unique globally (e.g., `8.8.8.8`).  
üîπ **Private IP** ‚Äì Used inside networks, not routable on the internet (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).  
üîπ **Static IP** ‚Äì Manually assigned, doesn‚Äôt change.  
üîπ **Dynamic IP** ‚Äì Assigned by DHCP, can change over time.  

### **IP Address Classes** (for Private Networks)  
| Class | Range | Default Subnet Mask |  
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|  
| **A** | 10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255 | 255.0.0.0 (/8) |  
| **B** | 172.16.0.0 ‚Äì 172.31.255.255 | 255.255.0.0 (/16) |  
| **C** | 192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255 | 255.255.255.0 (/24) |  

---

## **Subnetting**  
Subnetting divides a network into smaller networks. This helps **efficiently use IP addresses** and improves security & performance.  

A **Subnet Mask** determines the network & host portions of an IP.  
Example:  
üîπ `192.168.1.1/24` means **first 24 bits are for the network**, last 8 bits for hosts.  

### **CIDR Notation** (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
- `/8` = 16 million addresses  
- `/16` = 65,536 addresses  
- `/24` = 256 addresses (most common for local networks)  
- `/30` = 4 addresses (used for point-to-point links)  

üí° **Example**:  
If you have `192.168.1.0/24` (256 IPs) and split it into two subnets:  
- `192.168.1.0/25` ‚Üí 128 IPs  
- `192.168.1.128/25` ‚Üí 128 IPs  

Each subnet has **2 reserved addresses** (Network ID & Broadcast). 
--- 
## **DNS (Domain Name System)**  
DNS is like the **phonebook of the internet**‚Äîit translates **domain names** (e.g., `google.com`) into **IP addresses** (e.g., `142.250.183.14`) so computers can communicate.

### **How DNS Works**  
When you type `google.com` in your browser:  
1. **Your device checks its DNS cache** (local memory).  
2. **If not found, it queries a DNS resolver** (provided by ISP or custom like `8.8.8.8`).  
3. **Resolver checks root servers (`.`) ‚Üí TLD servers (`.com`) ‚Üí Authoritative DNS servers**.  
4. **Google‚Äôs authoritative server returns the IP**.  
5. **Your browser connects to `142.250.183.14` to load the website**.  

### **Types of DNS Records**  
| Record Type | Purpose | Example |  
|-------------|------------------|---------------------------|  
| **A** | Maps domain to IPv4 | `google.com ‚Üí 142.250.183.14` |  
| **AAAA** | Maps domain to IPv6 | `google.com ‚Üí 2607:f8b0::1` |  
| **CNAME** | Alias to another domain | `blog.example.com ‚Üí example.com` |  
| **MX** | Mail server for a domain | `gmail.com ‚Üí mail.google.com` |  
| **TXT** | Stores text data (e.g., SPF, DKIM) | Used for security & verification |  
| **NS** | Defines authoritative name servers | `ns1.example.com` |  
| **PTR** | Reverse lookup (IP ‚Üí domain) | `142.250.183.14 ‚Üí google.com` |  

### **Public vs Private DNS**
- **Public DNS**: Used for internet domains (Google DNS `8.8.8.8`, Cloudflare `1.1.1.1`).  
- **Private DNS**: Used inside organizations (AWS Route 53 Private Hosted Zones).  
---
### **DNS in AWS**  
AWS uses **Route 53** for DNS services. You can:  
- Create **public & private hosted zones**.  
- Manage **record types & routing policies**.  
- Use it for **failover, latency-based routing, or geolocation routing**.  
---
## **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**  

### **What is DHCP?**  
DHCP **automatically assigns IP addresses** and network settings to devices. Instead of manually setting up IPs, DHCP makes sure each device gets a unique IP from a pool.  

### **How DHCP Works (DORA Process)**  
1. **Discovery** ‚Äì Client broadcasts `DHCPDISCOVER` to find a server.  
2. **Offer** ‚Äì DHCP server responds with an `DHCPOFFER` (available IP + settings).  
3. **Request** ‚Äì Client sends `DHCPREQUEST` to accept the offered IP.  
4. **Acknowledge** ‚Äì Server confirms with a `DHCPACK`, and the client gets the IP.  

üí° **Example**: When you connect to Wi-Fi, DHCP automatically gives your device an IP like `192.168.1.10`, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS settings.  

### **DHCP Lease Time**  
- The IP address is **temporary** and must be renewed after a lease time.  
- Short lease time (e.g., 1 hour) is good for public Wi-Fi.  
- Long lease time (e.g., 7 days) is better for office networks.  

### **DHCP Components**  
| Component | Purpose |  
|-------------|--------------------------|  
| **DHCP Server** | Assigns IP addresses (e.g., router, AWS DHCP option set) |  
| **DHCP Client** | Requests an IP address (e.g., laptop, phone) |  
| **DHCP Relay** | Forwards DHCP requests across networks |  
| **DHCP Scope** | Range of available IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.10-192.168.1.100`) |  

---

### **DHCP in AWS**  
- AWS **does not provide a traditional DHCP server**. Instead, DHCP settings are managed via **DHCP Option Sets** in VPC.  
- You can specify **custom DNS servers, NTP servers, and domain names** for instances inside a VPC.  
- EC2 instances with **Auto-assign Public IP = enabled** get dynamic public IPs via AWS‚Äôs internal DHCP.  

---

### **Static vs Dynamic IP**  
| Feature | Static IP | Dynamic IP |  
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|  
| Assignment | Manually assigned | Assigned by DHCP |  
| Changes? | Never changes | Can change over time |  
| Used for? | Servers, DNS, databases | Laptops, phones, temporary devices |  
| Example | `192.168.1.2` (router) | `192.168.1.50` (laptop) |  

## **NAT (Network Address Translation)**  

### **What is NAT?**  
NAT allows multiple devices in a private network to access the internet **using a single public IP**. It translates **private IPs ‚Üî public IPs** for communication with external networks.  

üí° **Example:**  
Your home Wi-Fi router uses NAT. All your devices (laptop, phone, TV) have **private IPs**, but when they access the internet, they appear to have the same **public IP**.  

---

### **Types of NAT**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Static NAT** ‚Äì One-to-one mapping of private ‚Üî public IPs. (Used for servers)  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Dynamic NAT** ‚Äì Private IPs are mapped to a pool of public IPs.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **PAT (Port Address Translation)** ‚Äì Many private IPs share **one** public IP using different ports. (Most common type, used in home routers & AWS NAT Gateway)  

| NAT Type | Private ‚Üí Public Mapping | Use Case |  
|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|  
| Static NAT | 1 private IP ‚Üí 1 public IP | Hosting a public-facing server |  
| Dynamic NAT | Many private IPs ‚Üí Pool of public IPs | Enterprises with multiple public IPs |  
| PAT (Masquerade) | Many private IPs ‚Üí 1 public IP with different ports | Home networks, AWS NAT Gateway |  

---

### **NAT in AWS**  
AWS provides **two NAT options** for private instances to access the internet:  
üîπ **NAT Gateway** ‚Äì Fully managed, scalable, supports high traffic.  
üîπ **NAT Instance** ‚Äì A manually configured EC2 instance running NAT software.  

| Feature | NAT Gateway | NAT Instance |  
|-------------|------------------|------------------|  
| **Managed by AWS?** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No (Manual setup) |  
| **High availability?** | ‚úÖ Yes (AZ-specific) | ‚ùå No (Single instance) |  
| **Scalability?** | ‚úÖ Scales automatically | ‚ùå Needs manual scaling |  
| **Bandwidth** | ‚úÖ High (AWS optimized) | ‚ùå Limited by instance type |  
| **Security** | ‚úÖ Uses Security Groups & NACLs | ‚úÖ Can be customized |  

üí° **Best Practice:** Use **NAT Gateway** for production workloads since it's managed, scalable, and more reliable.  

---

### **Real-World Scenario**  
You have a **private EC2 instance** (`10.0.1.10`) that needs to **download OS updates from the internet** but doesn‚Äôt have a public IP.  

‚úÖ **Solution:**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy a **NAT Gateway** in a public subnet.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Associate it with an **Elastic IP**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Update the **private subnet‚Äôs route table** to send **0.0.0.0/0 ‚Üí NAT Gateway**.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Now, private EC2 can access the internet **outbound**, but no one can access it from outside.  

---
## **Network Protocols & Security**  

### **What are Network Protocols?**  
Network protocols are **rules and standards** that enable communication between devices over a network.  

### **Types of Network Protocols**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Communication Protocols** ‚Äì Define how data is transmitted.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Security Protocols** ‚Äì Protect data during transmission.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Routing Protocols** ‚Äì Help devices find the best path to send data.  

---

### **Common Network Protocols**  

| Protocol | Type | Purpose | Port | Example |  
|------------|------------|---------------------------------|------|----------------------|

| **HTTPS** | Communication | Secure web browsing | 443 | `https://example.com` |  
| **FTP** | File Transfer | Transfer files between systems | 21 | Uploading website files |  
| **SFTP** | Secure File Transfer | Encrypted file transfer | 22 | Secure file uploads |  
| **SSH** | Remote Access | Securely access remote servers | 22 | `ssh user@server` |  
| **Telnet** | Remote Access | Unsecure remote access | 23 | Deprecated (use SSH) |  
| **SMTP** | Email | Send emails | 25, 587 | Gmail SMTP servers |  
| **IMAP/POP3** | Email | Receive emails | 143/110 | Reading emails |

| **SNMP** | Monitoring | Network monitoring | 161 | Monitoring routers & servers |  
| **ICMP** | Diagnostic | Used for ping/traceroute | No port | Checking connectivity |  

---

### **Security Protocols**  

| Protocol | Purpose | Example |  
|------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|  
| **TLS/SSL** | Encrypts web traffic | `HTTPS, FTPS, SMTPS` |  
| **IPSec** | Secures VPN connections | Site-to-Site VPN |  
| **WPA/WPA2** | Secures Wi-Fi networks | Home & corporate Wi-Fi |  
| **Kerberos** | Authentication protocol | Windows Active Directory |  
| **LDAP** | Directory access protocol | User authentication |  

üí° **Example:** HTTPS uses **TLS encryption** to secure web traffic. Without it, data could be **intercepted** in plaintext.  

---

## **Network Security Concepts**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Firewalls**  
A firewall filters incoming and outgoing traffic based on rules.  
- **Host-based Firewall** ‚Äì Installed on a single machine (e.g., `iptables`, Windows Firewall).  
- **Network Firewall** ‚Äì Secures an entire network (e.g., AWS Security Groups, Palo Alto).  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ IDS & IPS (Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems)**  
- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)** ‚Äì Detects malicious traffic but **does not block** it.  
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)** ‚Äì **Detects & blocks** malicious traffic.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ VPN (Virtual Private Network)**  
Encrypts network traffic to create a secure **private connection over a public network**. Used for remote work & secure access to cloud networks.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Zero Trust Security**  
üîπ **"Never trust, always verify"** ‚Äì Every request is authenticated & authorized, even inside a private network.  
üîπ Used in **AWS IAM policies, Security Groups, and NACLs**.  

---

### **Network Security in AWS**  
| Security Feature | Purpose |  
|-----------------|-------------------------------|  
| **Security Groups (SGs)** | Acts as a virtual firewall for instances (stateful) |  
| **NACLs (Network ACLs)** | Controls traffic at the subnet level (stateless) |  
| **VPC Peering** | Securely connects two VPCs |  
| **VPN & Direct Connect** | Secures connections to AWS |  
| **AWS WAF** | Protects against web attacks |  

---
## **Network Troubleshooting**  

When network issues arise, you can use **diagnostic tools** to identify problems. Let's break them down:  

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Ping (Packet Internet Groper)**  
‚úÖ **Purpose:** Checks if a remote device is reachable and measures latency (round-trip time).  

üîπ **Command:**  
```sh
ping <IP or Domain>
```
üîπ **Example:**  
```sh
ping google.com
```
üîπ **Key Outputs:**  
- **Reply received** ‚Äì The host is online.  
- **Request timed out** ‚Äì The host is unreachable.  
- **Packet loss** ‚Äì Indicates network issues.  

üîπ **Options:**  
- `ping -c 4 google.com` ‚Üí Send only 4 packets.  
- `ping -i 2 google.com` ‚Üí Send pings every 2 seconds.  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Traceroute (Linux) / Tracert (Windows)**  
‚úÖ **Purpose:** Shows the path packets take to reach the destination and detects network slowdowns.  

üîπ **Command (Linux/macOS):**  
```sh
traceroute google.com
```
üîπ **Command (Windows):**  
```sh
tracert google.com
```
üîπ **Key Outputs:**  
- Each **hop** represents a router the packet passes through.  
- If a hop shows `* * *`, it might be **blocking ICMP traffic**.  

üí° **Example Output:**  
```
1  192.168.1.1  2.3 ms  (Local Router)
2  10.10.10.1   10.4 ms (ISP Gateway)
3  172.16.23.5  15.8 ms (Internet Backbone)
4  google.com   20.5 ms (Destination)
```
üîπ **Use Cases:**  
- If packets take **too many hops**, there might be **network congestion**.  
- If it stops at a certain hop, that router might be **down or misconfigured**.  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Netstat (Network Statistics)**  
‚úÖ **Purpose:** Displays active connections, listening ports, and network stats.  

üîπ **Command:**  
```sh
netstat -tulnp
```
üîπ **Options:**  
- `-t` ‚Üí Show TCP connections.  
- `-u` ‚Üí Show UDP connections.  
- `-l` ‚Üí Show listening ports.  
- `-n` ‚Üí Show numeric IPs (skip DNS resolution).  
- `-p` ‚Üí Show process ID (PID) of the application using the port.  

üí° **Example:** Find which process is using port 80.  
```sh
netstat -tulnp | grep :80
```
---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Tcpdump (Packet Sniffer - Linux/macOS)**  
‚úÖ **Purpose:** Captures network traffic for analysis.  

üîπ **Basic Usage:**  
```sh
tcpdump -i eth0
```
üîπ **Capture packets on a specific port (e.g., HTTP - 80):**  
```sh
tcpdump -i eth0 port 80
```
üîπ **Save capture to a file for later analysis:**  
```sh
tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
```
üîπ **Read a saved capture file:**  
```sh
tcpdump -r capture.pcap
```
üîπ **Filter packets by source/destination IP:**  
```sh
tcpdump src 192.168.1.10
```
üí° **Use Case:** Helps in debugging **packet drops, slow responses, or security threats**.

## **Real-World Scenario**  
üìå **Issue:** Your EC2 instance is unable to reach the internet.  
‚úÖ **Troubleshooting Steps:**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ `ping 8.8.8.8` ‚Üí If it fails, check instance connectivity.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ `traceroute 8.8.8.8` ‚Üí Find where the packet is dropping.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ `netstat -tulnp` ‚Üí Check if necessary ports are open.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ `tcpdump -i eth0` ‚Üí See if traffic is being blocked.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Check **Security Groups & NACLs** to ensure outbound rules allow traffic.  
---
### **SSL Basics & SSL Termination ‚Äì Simple Explanation**  

#### **üîπ What is SSL?**  
SSL (**Secure Sockets Layer**) is a protocol that encrypts data between a client (browser, API consumer) and a server, ensuring **secure communication**. TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the modern version of SSL, but people still call it **SSL/TLS**.  

#### **üîπ How SSL Works?**  
1. **Client (Browser) Requests a Secure Connection** ‚Üí It asks the server for an HTTPS connection.  
2. **Server Sends SSL Certificate** ‚Üí This certificate contains the server‚Äôs public key.  
3. **Client Verifies the Certificate** ‚Üí It checks if the SSL certificate is valid and trusted.  
4. **Secure Key Exchange Happens** ‚Üí A secure **session key** is created.  
5. **Encrypted Communication Begins** ‚Üí All data between client and server is now **encrypted**.  

---

### **üîπ SSL Termination**  

SSL termination means **decrypting SSL traffic at a load balancer or proxy** before sending it to backend servers. Instead of making each backend server handle encryption, the load balancer does it.  

#### **Why Use SSL Termination?**  
‚úÖ **Reduces Backend Load** ‚Üí Backend servers don‚Äôt need to handle encryption/decryption.  
‚úÖ **Improves Performance** ‚Üí Less CPU usage on backend servers.  
‚úÖ **Easier SSL Management** ‚Üí SSL certificates are handled at a single point (load balancer, proxy).  

#### **Where SSL Termination Happens?**  
- **Load Balancers** ‚Üí ALB, NLB, or third-party load balancers.  
- **Proxies** ‚Üí Nginx, HAProxy, Cloudflare, etc.  
- **CDN (CloudFront)** ‚Üí Terminates SSL at edge locations.  

---

### **üîπ Example: SSL Termination in AWS**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Client** ‚Üí Requests `https://app.example.com`.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **AWS ALB (SSL Termination)** ‚Üí ALB decrypts SSL and forwards **unencrypted (HTTP) traffic** to backend EC2/ECS/Lambda.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Backend (EC2/ECS/Lambda)** ‚Üí Handles the request normally without worrying about SSL.  

---

### **üîπ Alternative: End-to-End SSL (SSL Passthrough)**  
If security is critical, instead of terminating SSL at the load balancer, you can **keep SSL all the way to the backend**. This is called **SSL Passthrough**.  
üîπ **Use case?** When sensitive data needs full encryption, like financial or healthcare apps.  

---

### **Final Thoughts**  
- **SSL protects data** by encrypting it between client and server.  
- **SSL termination offloads encryption work** from backend servers, improving performance.  
- **In AWS, ALB, NLB, CloudFront, and API Gateway** can handle SSL termination.
