### **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - Fundamentals**  

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated network environment within AWS that enables users to provision and manage cloud resources with granular control over IP addressing, subnetting, routing, and security.  

VPC provides **highly available, scalable, and secure** networking infrastructure within AWS, allowing organizations to build cloud-based architectures with **fine-grained control** over traffic flow, security, and connectivity.

## **1️⃣ Subnets (Public & Private)**  
A **VPC subnet** is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. It can be **public** or **private**, depending on whether it has internet access.

### **🔹 Public Subnet**  
✅ **Has a route to the Internet Gateway (IGW)** → Used for EC2 instances that need to communicate with the internet.  

🔹 Example:  
- **Web servers**  
- **Bastion hosts**  

### **🔹 Private Subnet**  
✅ **No direct internet access** → Used for resources that should remain private.  

🔹 Example:  
- **Databases (RDS, DynamoDB)**  
- **Application servers**  
- **Internal microservices**  

---

## **2️⃣ Route Table & Subnet Route Table Association**  
A **Route Table** defines **how traffic is routed** within a VPC. Each subnet must be **associated** with a route table.

### **🔹 Default Route Table (Local Routing)**  
By default, all subnets in a VPC can **communicate with each other** through local routing.

### **🔹 Custom Route Table Example**  
- Public Subnet → **Has a route to IGW**  
- Private Subnet → **Has a route to NAT Gateway (for outbound traffic)**  

🔹 Example Route Table:  

| Destination   | Target       | Purpose |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| 10.0.0.0/16 | local       | Internal VPC traffic |
| 0.0.0.0/0   | igw-xxxxxx  | Public internet access |
| 0.0.0.0/0   | nat-xxxxxx  | Private subnet access via NAT |

## **3️⃣ Internet Gateway (IGW)**  
✅ **IGW allows internet access** for resources in the VPC.  

🔹 **How it works:**  
- IGW is attached to the VPC.  
- A public subnet must have a **route to IGW** in its route table.  
- EC2 instances in a public subnet need an **Elastic IP** or **public IP**.  

🔹 **Command to attach IGW (AWS CLI):**  
```sh
aws ec2 attach-internet-gateway --internet-gateway-id igw-xxxx --vpc-id vpc-xxxx
```

---

## **4️⃣ NAT Gateway & Elastic IP (EIP)**  
✅ **NAT Gateway (NATGW) allows private instances to access the internet** without exposing them publicly.

🔹 **Use Case:**  
- Private EC2 instances need to download software updates.  
- A private backend server needs to call an external API.  

🔹 **How it works:**  
- NATGW is placed in a **public subnet**.  
- It has an **Elastic IP (EIP)** for outbound traffic.  
- Private subnets route internet traffic via NATGW.

---

## **5️⃣ Security Groups (SG) - Instance-Level Firewall**  
✅ **SGs control inbound & outbound traffic for instances.**  

🔹 **Rules are STATEFUL** → If inbound traffic is allowed, the response is automatically allowed.  

🔹 **Example SG Rules:**  
| Type  | Protocol | Port  | Source      | Purpose        |
|-------|---------|------|------------|--------------|
| SSH   | TCP     | 22   | My IP only | Admin Access  |
| HTTP  | TCP     | 80   | 0.0.0.0/0  | Public Web App |

---

## **6️⃣ NACLs (Network ACLs) - Subnet-Level Firewall**  
✅ **NACLs control traffic at the subnet level.**  

🔹 **Rules are STATELESS** → Both inbound and outbound rules must be explicitly defined.  

🔹 **Example NACL Rules:**  
| Rule # | Type  | Protocol | Port  | Source     | Action |
|--------|------|---------|------|-----------|--------|
| 100    | HTTP  | TCP     | 80   | 0.0.0.0/0 | ALLOW  |
| 200    | SSH   | TCP     | 22   | 0.0.0.0/0 | DENY   |

✅ **Use Case:**  
- Extra layer of security beyond Security Groups.  
- Block malicious IPs at the subnet level.  

---

## **7️⃣ VPC Peering**  
✅ **Allows communication between two VPCs** over AWS internal network.  

🔹 **Use Case:**  
- Connecting different AWS accounts.  
- Connecting microservices in separate VPCs.  

🔹 **Key Points:**  
- Peering is **one-to-one** (not transitive).  
- No overlapping CIDR blocks.  
- Route tables must be updated for traffic flow.  

🔹 **AWS CLI Command:**  
```sh
aws ec2 create-vpc-peering-connection --vpc-id vpc-1 --peer-vpc-id vpc-2
```

---

## **8️⃣ VPC Flow Logs**  
✅ **Monitors network traffic** going in and out of your VPC.

🔹 **Use Case:**  
- Debugging connectivity issues.  
- Security monitoring (detecting unauthorized access).  

🔹 **Log Destination:**  
- CloudWatch  
- S3  

🔹 **AWS CLI Command to Enable Flow Logs:**  
```sh
aws ec2 create-flow-logs --resource-type VPC --resource-ids vpc-xxxx --traffic-type ALL --log-destination arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:xxxx:log-group/vpc-logs
```

---

## **9️⃣ VPC Endpoints (Gateway & Interface)**  
✅ **Allows AWS services (like S3, DynamoDB) to be accessed privately from a VPC** without using IGW or NATGW.  

🔹 **Types:**  
- **Gateway Endpoint** → Used for S3, DynamoDB (routes added in route table).  
- **Interface Endpoint** → Used for services like SNS, SQS, Secrets Manager (Elastic Network Interface created).  

🔹 **AWS CLI Example:**  
```sh
aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint --vpc-id vpc-xxxx --service-name com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3 --vpc-endpoint-type Gateway
```

---

## **🔟 Transit Gateway (TGW)**  
✅ **Connects multiple VPCs and on-premises networks** in a hub-and-spoke model.  

🔹 **Key Benefits:**  
- More **scalable than VPC Peering** (supports multiple VPCs).  
- Simplifies **network architecture**.  
- Reduces the number of route table updates.  

🔹 **Example Use Case:**  
- Connecting multiple VPCs to a **centralized firewall** or **VPN**.  

---

## **1️⃣1️⃣ Traffic Mirroring (Phase-2 Learning)**  
✅ **Captures and inspects traffic** in a VPC by mirroring network packets.  

🔹 **Use Cases:**  
- **Security analysis** (detect intrusions).  
- **Network monitoring** (detect performance issues).
