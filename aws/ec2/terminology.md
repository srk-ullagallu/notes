## üõ°Ô∏è **1. High Availability (HA)**

- Ensures that a system or service **remains accessible** and functional even when some components fail.
- Often implemented by deploying **multiple instances across different Availability Zones (AZs)** or regions.
- Load Balancers automatically redirect traffic to healthy instances if an instance fails.

**Example**: In **AWS**, you can place your instances across multiple Availability Zones and use an **Application Load Balancer** to maintain HA.

---

## üîÑ **2. Redundancy**

- Redundancy means **having backup components or systems** ready to take over if the primary system fails.
- It eliminates single points of failure by duplicating critical parts of your infrastructure.
  
**How it's Implemented**:
- Deploy **multiple instances** of the same service across different AZs or regions.
- Use **Load Balancers** to ensure traffic is rerouted automatically.
  
**Example**: Deploying an **EC2 instance in three Availability Zones** with an **ALB** distributing requests.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **3. Fault Tolerance**

- **Fault Tolerance** ensures that the system continues operating smoothly even when a failure occurs.
- Often combines **redundancy with automated recovery mechanisms**.

**Common Techniques**:
- **Automatic Instance Recovery**: Automatically restarts failed instances.
- **Multi-AZ Deployments**: Deploy services across different Availability Zones to avoid downtime.

**Example**: An **Auto Scaling Group in AWS** automatically replaces unhealthy instances.

## üìà **4. Scalability**

Scalability refers to **the system's ability to handle increased load by adding resources**.

---

### üÜô **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up/Scale Down)**
- Involves **adding more CPU, RAM, or storage to a single machine** (e.g., upgrading an EC2 instance).
- Typically, this is **cost-effective for small-scale increases but has physical limitations**.

**Pros**:
- Simple to implement.
- Requires only a single server upgrade.

**Cons**:
- Physical hardware constraints.
- Can only scale to the limits of a single machine.

**Example**: Upgrading an EC2 instance from `t2.micro` to `t2.large`.

---

### ‚û°Ô∏è **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out/Scale In)**
- Involves **adding more machines or instances** to distribute the load.
- Horizontal scaling offers **greater scalability and fault tolerance**.

**Techniques**:
- Deploy **multiple EC2 instances behind an ALB** or **multiple containers in ECS**.
- Use **Auto Scaling Groups** to dynamically add or remove instances.

**Pros**:
- More flexible and scalable.
- Higher fault tolerance due to distributed infrastructure.

**Cons**:
- Higher complexity in load distribution and orchestration.

**Example**: Automatically adding more instances to an **Auto Scaling Group** based on traffic demand.

### üìå **Throughput and IOPS Explained** üöÄ

In cloud storage and infrastructure, **Throughput** and **IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)** are critical performance metrics to measure the speed and efficiency of storage systems. Let's break down these concepts in detail.

---

## üìù **Key Terminology**

---

### üîπ **1. Throughput**

- **Throughput** is the measure of how much **data can be transferred in a given period of time**.
- It is typically expressed in **Megabytes per second (MB/s)** or **Gigabytes per second (GB/s)**.
- In simple terms, throughput indicates the **rate at which data is read from or written to a storage system**.

---

#### üìä **Formula for Throughput**

\[
\text{Throughput} = \frac{\text{Total Data Transferred}}{\text{Time}}
\]

- For example, **100 MB transferred in 10 seconds** ‚Üí Throughput = 10 MB/s.

---

### üîπ **2. IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)**

- **IOPS** measures the **number of input/output operations your storage system can perform each second**.
- It is a **quantitative metric**, often crucial for database and application performance.
- Commonly, IOPS depends on factors like **disk type, storage technology, latency, and provisioning**.

---

#### üìä **Formula for IOPS**

\[
\text{IOPS} = \frac{\text{Number of I/O Operations}}{\text{Time (seconds)}}
\]

- For example, **5000 I/O operations completed in 10 seconds** ‚Üí IOPS = 500.

---

## üîç **Differences Between Throughput and IOPS**

| **Attribute**     | **Throughput**                         | **IOPS**                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | Rate of data transfer (MB/s/GB/s)   | Number of read/write operations per second   |
| **Measurement**     | Measured in **MB/s or GB/s**       | Measured in **Operations/Second**         |
| **Optimal Use Case**| Large data transfers               | High-frequency database operations        |
| **Dependency Factors** | Affected by **Network, Bandwidth, Disk Type** | Affected by **Disk Type, Latency, Workload** |
