### **Basic Docker Commands (Simple Explanation)**  

#### **1. Container Management**  
- **Run** → `docker run image_name` → Starts a new container.  
- **Stop** → `docker stop container_id` → Gracefully stops a running container.  
- **Pause** → `docker pause container_id` → Freezes a running container.  
- **Unpause** → `docker unpause container_id` → Resumes a paused container.  
- **Remove Container** → `docker rm container_id` → Deletes a stopped container. 

### **Container Life Cycle - Simple Points**  

1. **Created** – Container is created but not running.  
2. **Running** – Container is actively running the application.  
3. **Paused** – Container is temporarily frozen (stopped but not exited).  
4. **Stopped** – Container is shut down but still exists.  
5. **Restarting** – Container is stopping and starting again.  
6. **Exited** – Container has stopped permanently.  
7. **Removed** – Container is deleted from the system.  



#### **2. Image Management**  
- **Remove Image** → `docker rmi image_id` → Deletes a Docker image.  
- **View Image History** → `docker history image_id` → Shows how an image was built.  

#### **3. Logs & Monitoring**  
- **View Logs** → `docker logs container_id` → Displays container logs.  
- **Inspect Details** → `docker inspect container_id/image_id` → Shows detailed info.  
- **Container Stats** → `docker stats` → Shows real-time resource usage of running containers.  

#### **4. Networking & Volumes**  
- **List Networks** → `docker network ls` → Shows available Docker networks.  
- **List Volumes** → `docker volume ls` → Displays all Docker volumes.  

#### **5. Restart Policies**  
- `--restart=no` → No automatic restart.  
- `--restart=on-failure` → Restarts only if the container exits with an error.  
- `--restart=always` → Always restarts the container.  
- `--restart=unless-stopped` → Restarts unless manually stopped.  

#### **6. System Info & Cleanup**  
- **System Info** → `docker system info` → Displays Docker environment details.  
- **Disk Usage** → `docker system df` → Shows Docker disk space usage.

### **Dockerfile Instructions (Simple Explanation)**  

#### **1. Basic Instructions**  
- **FROM** → Defines the base image (e.g., `FROM ubuntu`).  
- **RUN** → Executes a command while building the image (e.g., `RUN apt-get update`).  
- **COPY** → Copies files from the host to the container (e.g., `COPY app.py /app/`).  
- **ADD** → Like COPY but can handle remote URLs and archives (e.g., `ADD app.tar.gz /app/`).  
- **WORKDIR** → Sets the working directory for commands (e.g., `WORKDIR /app`).  
- **EXPOSE** → Informs Docker that a port should be open (e.g., `EXPOSE 80`).  

#### **2. CMD vs ENTRYPOINT**  
- Containers are **not meant to host an OS** but to run a **specific task or process** (e.g., a web server or database).  
- A container **exists as long as the inside process is running**. If the process stops or crashes, the container stops.  
- **Who defines what process runs inside the container?** → **CMD or ENTRYPOINT**.  

#### **3. CMD (Command)**  
- Specifies the **default command** to run in a container.  
- Can be overridden when running the container.  
- **Shell Form**: `CMD sleep 5` (executed in a shell).  
- **JSON Form**: `CMD ["sleep", "5"]` (executed directly).  

#### **4. ENTRYPOINT**  
- Defines the main **executable** that always runs inside the container.  
- **CMD can pass arguments to ENTRYPOINT**.  
- Example:  
  ```dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu  
  ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]  
  CMD ["5"]  
  ```
  - Running `docker run ubuntu 25` automatically **invokes CMD (5 is replaced by 25)**.  

#### **5. CMD vs ENTRYPOINT Differences**  
| Feature        | CMD                  | ENTRYPOINT           |  
|--------------|-----------------|------------------|  
| Purpose     | Default command | Main executable |  
| Overridable? | Easily overridden with `docker run ubuntu command` | Requires `--entrypoint` to override |  
| Parameters  | Replaced entirely | Appended |  

#### **6. Overriding ENTRYPOINT**  
- Use `--entrypoint` to override ENTRYPOINT at runtime:  
  ```sh
  docker run --entrypoint ls ubuntu
  ```  
  This will replace `sleep` with `ls`.

### **Difference Between Shell Form and Executable Form**  

| **Aspect**        | **Shell Form** (`CMD sleep 5`) | **Executable Form** (`CMD ["sleep", "5"]`) |  
|-------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|  
| **Execution Method** | Runs inside a shell (`/bin/sh -c` on Linux) | Runs directly as an executable |  
| **Behavior** | Allows shell features (like `&&`, `|`, variables) but can cause issues with signals | More reliable for signal handling and recommended for production |



### **Docker Layers and Build Optimization**  

#### **1. How Docker Uses Layers**  
- Each **instruction** in a `Dockerfile` (`FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, etc.) creates a new **layer**.  
- During `docker build`, Docker **compares instructions** to reuse **cached layers** and avoid rebuilding unchanged layers.  
- If a build fails at **layer 4**, fixing the issue and rebuilding will **only rebuild from that layer onward**, keeping earlier layers.  
- If **two images share common layers**, Docker reuses those layers to **speed up builds**.  

#### **2. Cache Busting & Combining Instructions**  
- Docker caches layers, but if a layer changes, **all subsequent layers get rebuilt**.  
- To optimize caching, **combine commands** using `\` to reduce unnecessary layers:  
  ```dockerfile
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
      hello \
      hi
  ```  
- **Most frequently modified instructions** should be at the **bottom** of the `Dockerfile`.  
- **Least frequently modified instructions** should be at the **top** to maximize caching.  

#### **3. Multi-Stage Builds for Optimization**  
- **Multi-stage builds** help keep final images small by discarding unnecessary build dependencies.  
- Example:  
  ```dockerfile
  FROM golang AS builder
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY . .
  RUN go build -o myapp
  
  FROM alpine
  COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp
  CMD ["/myapp"]
  ```  
  - The final image **only contains the compiled binary**, not the entire Go environment.  

#### **4. Key Takeaways**  
✅ **Docker layers speed up builds** by reusing unchanged steps.  
✅ **Optimizing the order of instructions improves caching efficiency.**  
✅ **Multi-stage builds keep images lightweight.**  
✅ **Cache busting should be managed carefully** to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.


### **Docker Volumes (Simple Explanation)**  

#### **1. Bind Mounts**  
- Maps a specific directory from the host machine to the container.  
- Changes made in the container reflect on the host and vice versa.  
- Used when the container needs direct access to host files.  
- Example: `docker run -v /host/path:/container/path my-app`  

#### **2. Named Volumes**  
- Managed by Docker and stored in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`.  
- Not tied to a specific host path, making it easier to manage and share between containers.  
- Best for **persistent storage** across container restarts.  
- Example: `docker volume create my_volume`  

#### **3. Anonymous Volumes**  
- Similar to named volumes but without a specific name.  
- Docker automatically assigns a random name.  
- Used when temporary storage is needed without manual management.  
- Example: `docker run -v /container/path my-app` (without specifying a host path or volume name).

### **Docker Networking (Simple Explanation)**  

#### **1. Bridge Network (Single Host)**  
- **Default Bridge Network**  
  - Automatically created by Docker.  
  - Containers can communicate using IP addresses but not by name.  
  - Need to use `--link` (deprecated) or user-defined networks for better communication.  

- **Custom Bridge Network**  
  - User-created network (`docker network create`).  
  - Containers can communicate using container names instead of IP addresses.  
  - Provides better control over networking settings.  

#### **2. Overlay Network (Multi-Host)**  
- Allows containers on different hosts to communicate.  
- Used in **Docker Swarm** for multi-node setups.  
- Enables container-to-container communication across multiple machines.  

#### **3. Host Network**  
- The container directly uses the host machine's network.  
- No isolation between the container and host.  
- Best for applications needing low-latency network access.  

#### **4. None Network**  
- Completely disables networking for the container.  
- No internet access or communication with other containers.  
- Used for security or custom networking configurations.


### **Docker Port Mapping**  

#### **1. Manual Port Mapping (`-p`)**  
- Syntax: `-p <host-port>:<container-port>`  
- Maps a specific **host port** to a **container port**.  
- Example:  
  ```sh
  docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
  ```  
  - This maps **host port `8080`** to **container port `80`** (Nginx web server).  
  - Access the container at `http://localhost:8080`.  

#### **2. Automatic Port Mapping (`-P`)**  
- Assigns **random (ephemeral) ports** on the host for exposed container ports.  
- Example:  
  ```sh
  docker run -d -P nginx
  ```  
  - Docker will randomly assign a **host port** for **each `EXPOSE`d port** in the image.  
  - Run `docker ps` to check assigned ports.  

#### **3. `EXPOSE` Instruction in Dockerfile**  
- Used to document which ports the container **expects to be available**.  
- Does **not** publish the port automatically—only informs users.  
- Example in `Dockerfile`:  
  ```dockerfile
  FROM nginx  
  EXPOSE 80  
  ```  
  - The container **still needs `-p` or `-P`** to be accessible externally.  

✅ **Use `-p` for fixed ports and `-P` for automatic port assignment!** 🚀



Yes! Here are a few more **important** Docker best practices:  

- ✅ **Use official images** – They are secure and well-maintained.  
- ✅ **Use small base images** – Reduces image size and attack surface (`alpine`, `distroless`).  
- ✅ **Use multi-stage builds** – Keeps final images small by removing unnecessary dependencies.  
- ✅ **Use a custom user instead of root** – Improves security by restricting privileges.  
- ✅ **Minimize layers** – Combine `RUN` commands to reduce unnecessary layers.  
- ✅ **Use `.dockerignore`** – Exclude unnecessary files (`node_modules`, `.git`, etc.).  
- ✅ **Tag images properly** – Avoid using `latest`; use specific versions (`nginx:1.25`).  
- ✅ **Keep containers stateless** – Store data in volumes instead of inside containers.  
- ✅ **Limit container privileges** – Use `--read-only`, `--cap-drop`, and `seccomp` profiles.  
- ✅ **Regularly scan images** – Use tools like `trivy` or `docker scan` for vulnerabilities.  

These ensure **security, performance, and efficient builds**! 🚀
