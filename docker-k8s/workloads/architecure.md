### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Services and kube-proxy**

- A **Service** in Kubernetes provides a stable IP and DNS name for a group of **Pods**.
- kube-proxy listens to the Kubernetes API server for **Service** and **Endpoints** changes.
- It creates and updates **network rules** on each node based on these changes.

#### Example: ClusterIP Service
- A `ClusterIP` Service is exposed internally in the cluster.
- kube-proxy sets up rules so that traffic to the **Service IP** is load-balanced to one of the **Pod IPs** behind it.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Endpoints and kube-proxy**

- When a Pod is created or deleted, Kubernetes updates the **Endpoints** of the Service.
- kube-proxy dynamically updates the network rules to point to the correct set of **Pod IPs**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Modes of kube-proxy**

1. **iptables (default on most systems)**  
   - Uses `iptables` rules to redirect traffic.
   - Packets are sent directly to the Pod IP.

2. **IPVS (IP Virtual Server)**  
   - More efficient for large-scale clusters.
   - Handles load balancing in the kernel space.

3. **Userspace (legacy, rarely used)**  
   - kube-proxy forwards traffic in user space.
   - Slower and less efficient.

## üåê **How Traffic Flows (Example)**

1. A client makes a request to the **Service IP** (`ClusterIP`) on port `80`.
2. kube-proxy intercepts this traffic.
3. It checks the **Endpoint** list for the Service.
4. Based on the rules, it forwards the traffic to one of the **Pod IPs** behind the Service.

### üîÑ **If a Pod is Removed**
- kube-proxy detects the change via the Kubernetes API.
- It updates the network rules to remove the stale Pod IP from the Service's Endpoints.

---

## üß† **Key Takeaways**
- **kube-proxy** ensures that requests to a **Service IP** are routed to the correct **Pod IP**.
- It uses either **iptables**, **IPVS**, or **userspace** to manage network rules.
- kube-proxy adapts dynamically when Pods are added, removed, or changed.
