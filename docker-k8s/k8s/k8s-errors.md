

Kubernetes pods can encounter various errors due to configuration mistakes, resource limitations, or issues with the underlying infrastructure. Below are the common types of Kubernetes pod errors categorized for better understanding:

---

## 🛑 **1. Image Errors**
These occur when Kubernetes cannot pull or run the container image.

- **`ErrImagePull`**: Kubernetes is unable to pull the specified container image from the registry.  
- **`ImagePullBackOff`**: Kubernetes retries pulling the image but repeatedly fails.  
- **`InvalidImageName`**: The container image name is malformed or incorrect.  

**🔍 Common Causes:**  
- Wrong image name or tag  
- Image does not exist in the registry  
- Authentication issues with the private registry  

---

## ⚠️ **2. Resource Errors**
These happen when the pod exceeds allocated CPU or memory resources.

- **`OOMKilled`**: The pod ran out of memory and was killed by the system.  
- **`CPUThrottling`**: The container is consuming more CPU than its allocated limit.  
- **`FailedScheduling`**: The scheduler cannot place the pod on any node due to insufficient resources.

**🔍 Common Causes:**  
- Insufficient CPU or memory limits defined  
- Nodes are fully utilized  
- Resource requests and limits mismatch  

---

## 🔗 **3. Node and Infrastructure Errors**
Issues related to nodes or the infrastructure.

- **`NodeNotReady`**: The node where the pod is scheduled is not ready.  
- **`NetworkUnavailable`**: Network plugin or CNI (Container Network Interface) is misconfigured.  
- **`Evicted`**: The pod was evicted from the node due to resource pressure.

**🔍 Common Causes:**  
- Node crashes or restarts  
- Network plugin issues  
- Disk pressure on the node

## ⚙️ **4. Configuration Errors**
Mistakes in Kubernetes manifest files or environment variables.

- **`CrashLoopBackOff`**: The container starts, crashes, and restarts repeatedly.  
- **`CreateContainerConfigError`**: The pod has invalid configuration for environment variables or volume mounts.  
- **`CreateContainerError`**: Kubernetes cannot create the container due to invalid parameters.

**🔍 Common Causes:**  
- Wrong command or entry point in the container  
- Invalid environment variables  
- Misconfigured volume mounts  

---

## 📡 **5. Readiness and Liveness Probe Errors**
Issues with health checks defined in pod specs.

- **`ReadinessProbeFailed`**: The readiness probe fails, and the pod is marked as not ready.  
- **`LivenessProbeFailed`**: The liveness probe fails, causing the pod to restart.

**🔍 Common Causes:**  
- Incorrect probe path or port  
- Slow application startup  
- Application crash  

---

## 🔒 **6. PersistentVolume (PV) Errors**
Storage-related issues.

- **`VolumeMountError`**: The pod fails to mount the persistent volume.  
- **`VolumeNotFound`**: The specified volume does not exist.  
- **`FailedAttachVolume`**: Kubernetes could not attach the volume to the node.

**🔍 Common Causes:**  
- Storage class misconfiguration  
- Volume already mounted elsewhere  
- Insufficient disk space  

---

## 🐞 **7. Application-Level Errors**
Errors caused by issues in the application code or dependencies.

- **Application Crashes:** The application inside the container crashes unexpectedly.  
- **Port Binding Issues:** The application fails to bind to the specified port.  
- **Timeouts:** Application is taking too long to start.

**🔍 Common Causes:**  
- Bugs in the application  
- Dependency failures  
- Incorrect port configurations  

---

## 📝 **8. Pending State**
The pod remains stuck in a `Pending` state indefinitely.

**🔍 Common Causes:**  
- Insufficient resources on nodes  
- Unschedulable node affinity/taints  
- PersistentVolume claims not bound

### 🚀 **How to Debug Pod Errors?**
- **Check Pod Events:**  
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
  ```
- **Check Pod Logs:**  
  ```bash
  kubectl logs <pod-name>
  ```
- **Check Node Status:**  
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  ```
- **Check Resource Requests and Limits:**  
  Review resource specifications in pod manifest files.
