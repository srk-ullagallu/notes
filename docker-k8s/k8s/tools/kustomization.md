### Kustomize vs. Helm in Kubernetes  

#### Problem with Direct Kubernetes Manifests  
- Deploying applications using raw Kubernetes manifests is not a good practice.  
- Different environments require different values, leading to:  
  - Frequent errors when modifying manifests.  
  - Duplication if separate folders are maintained for each environment.  

#### Kustomize (Native Kubernetes Configuration Tool)  
- Kustomize allows overriding values without modifying the original manifests.  
- Uses **patching** instead of templating.  
- It is built into `kubectl`.  
- **Base & Overlay Structure:**  
  - **Base (Parent Files):** Contains the original manifests.  
  - **Overlays (Environment-Specific Customizations):** Modify the base without duplication.  

##### Example Kustomize Structure  
```
base/
  ├── deployment.yaml
  ├── service.yaml
  ├── hpa.yaml
  ├── configmap.yaml
  ├── secrets.yaml
  ├── kustomization.yaml  # Lists resources

overlays/
  ├── dev/
  │   ├── kustomization.yaml
  │   ├── replicas.yaml
  ├── stage/
  ├── prod/
```

##### `kustomization.yaml` (Overlays Example - Dev)  
```yaml
resources:
  - ../../base

patches:
  - replicas.yaml

namePrefix: dev-

images:
  - name: nginx
    newName: nginx
    newTag: "latest"
```

##### Kustomize Commands  
```sh
kubectl kustomize base                # View base manifests  
kubectl kustomize overlays/dev        # View dev environment manifests  
kubectl apply -k overlays/dev         # Apply dev environment configuration  
```

#### Helm vs. Kustomize  
| Feature       | Kustomize | Helm |
|--------------|----------|------|
| Approach     | Patching | Templating |
| Complexity   | Simpler  | More powerful |
| Reusability  | Limited  | High |
| Built into `kubectl` | ✅ | ❌ |

- **Helm** is more powerful for managing deployments but adds complexity.  
- **Kustomize** is a lightweight, template-free alternative but has limitations compared to Helm.
