### **Falco - Kubernetes Runtime Security Tool**  

Falco is an open-source **runtime security tool** designed for **Kubernetes, containers, and cloud environments**. It detects suspicious activity by monitoring system calls in real-time.  

### **Key Features**  
✅ **Behavior Monitoring** – Tracks system calls to detect abnormal activity.  
✅ **Kubernetes-Native** – Works seamlessly in Kubernetes clusters.  
✅ **Real-Time Alerts** – Sends alerts when suspicious behavior is detected.  
✅ **Custom Rules** – Define security policies based on your needs.  
✅ **Integration with Security Tools** – Works with Prometheus, Grafana, and SIEM solutions.  

### **How It Works**  
1. **Falco runs as a DaemonSet** in Kubernetes.  
2. It **monitors system calls** and compares them with security rules.  
3. If a suspicious event is detected, **Falco triggers an alert**.  
4. The alert can be sent to **Slack, Syslog, Prometheus, or any other tool**.  

### **Example Detection Rule**  
This rule detects if someone tries to read a sensitive file like `/etc/shadow`:  
```yaml
- rule: Read Sensitive File
  desc: Detect when a sensitive file is read
  condition: open_read and fd.name contains /etc/shadow
  output: "Sensitive file read by %user.name"
  priority: WARNING
```

### **Use Cases**  
- Detecting **crypto mining** inside containers.  
- Identifying **unauthorized access** to sensitive files.  
- Alerting on **privilege escalation** attempts.  
- Monitoring **unexpected process execution** inside a pod.
