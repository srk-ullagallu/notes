You need to deploy a multi-container application with interdependent 
services that communicate with each other. How would you set up 
networking and communication between these containers in Docker?

To set up networking and communication between interdependent 
containers in Docker, I would follow these steps: 
1. Define a Docker network: Create a Docker network using the `docker 
network create` command. This network will allow containers to 
communicate with each other using DNS-based service discovery. 
2. Run the containers on the same network: When running the containers, 
assign them to the same Docker network using the `--network` option. 
This ensures that they can communicate with each other.
3. Assign unique container names: Provide unique names to each container 
using the `--name` option. This makes it easier to reference and 
communicate with specific containers. 
4. Utilize container DNS names: Docker automatically assigns DNS 
names to containers based on their names. Containers can communicate 
with each other using these DNS names as hostnames. 
5. Expose necessary ports: If a container needs to expose a port for 
communication with external services, use the `--publish` or `-p` option to 
map the container's port to a host port. 
6. Configure environment variables: Set environment variables in each 
container to specify connection details or configuration parameters 
required for inter-container communication. 
7. Test communication between containers: Validate the communication 
between containers by running tests or executing commands within the 
containers to ensure that they can access and communicate with the 
required services.

SSL Certificate management is really important for a Devops Engineer. Let's break down some key terms.


Certificate Authority (CA): A trusted entity that issues and validates TLS certificates.

TLS Certificate: A digital credential that verifies the identity of a server or client, ensuring encrypted and authenticated communication.

Private Key: A secret key tied to a specific certificate, used by a server or client to prove its identity.

Public Key: The non-secret part of a certificate‚Äôs key pair. It can be shared openly and is used by others to verify signatures and encrypt data for the entity holding the corresponding private key.

Secret Object: Kubernetes resource used to store TLS certificates and keys securely, often referenced by Ingress controllers and workloads.

cert-manager: A popular Kubernetes add-on that automates the creation, renewal, and management of TLS certificates.

Brilliant Security Feature Of K8s 1.30

Have you explored "User Namespaces", this feature allows a process to have full privileges for actions within the user namespace but is restricted for actions outside of it.

In simple words, this allows running a process as a non-root user on the host, even if it runs as root within the container.

Here is how it enhances security in several ways:

Limited Privileges: The process has full privileges only within the container's user namespace. Outside of this namespace, it operates with restricted privileges, reducing the risk of it performing harmful actions on the host system.

Damage Containment: If a container is compromised, the attacker gains root access only within the container. This limits the potential damage to the container itself and prevents the attacker from gaining root access to the host or other containers.

Isolation: By running processes with different user IDs, it ensures that even if one container is compromised, the attacker cannot easily affect other containers or the host system.

Compliance and Auditing: Running processes as non-root users can help meet security compliance requirements and make it easier to audit and monitor activities, as actions performed by non-root users are more easily tracked and controlled.

Overall, this approach significantly reduces the attack surface and enhances the overall security posture of the system. 

Adding `externalTrafficPolicy: Local` and `sessionAffinity: ClientIP` enhances performance by reducing latency and ensuring client sessions stick to the same pod.

üí• New project update üí• - Shell scripting üë©‚Äçüíª 

Hey guys! So after learning shell scripting from various sources including Avinash Reddy Thipparthi & Abhishek Veeramalla, I tried writing a script all of my own!
Its a simple yet powerful script that will help you *Modify the file permissions* of n number of files all at once! 

Perks of this project :
 - Can modify permissions for multiple files at a time.
 - We can also include files that are present in other directories.
 - useful for those who want to give multiple files access to new people in the organizations.

Struggles I faced & Improvements I did while writing this script :
- The first idea of writing a script was automating the file permission-modification of a single file! But after running the script, I realized it was time consuming than doing it manually üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è . So I want to make it for multiple files! 
(I used some Read & array functions for accepting multiple inputs from the user at once üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è )
- And the next thing I struggled with is, processing the files again & again without asking the users to input the data once more! (looping statements helped me with this üññ )
- And also added some trouble shooting functions in the script in case if some files doesn't exist, it will notify us and will also show us the updated file permissions of our given files üòä .

you can see the Screenshots and the recordings of the output below üëá 
open for suggestions & feedback from you guys! And have a nice day all.. More way to go :)

1. How do you uncommit the changes that have already been pushed to GitHub? 
2. If there is suddenly the file is deleted in git how do you get it back? 
3. Can you increase the size of the root volume without shutting down the instance?
4. If you lost the .pem file then how will you connect to EC2? 
5. S3 bucket having a policy for only read-only but you‚Äôre having full access for you? Can you modify s3 objects? 
6. Difference between Classic ELB and Application ELB?
7. How many subnets are assigned to the routing table? 
8. In your VPC all IPS are finished you require resources how to provision it? 
9. Are you only using cloud watch for monitoring?
10.If your using load balancing in 2 availability zones den which load balancer you should use?
11. can you write docker file where Linux env condition deploy static webserver 
12. Is it possible to run any VM in AWS without creating any EC2 instance ? 
13. I want to create a pipeline in Jenkins which needs to have 10 different stages and based on my input it needs to execute some stages not every stages how you will configure that .
14. What are the Terraform modules? Have used any modules in the project?
15. Is it possible to configure communication between 2 servers those are having private access
16. What happens when you delete /var/lib/docker/overlay?
17. Write a simple script that calls with ‚ÄúFoo‚Äù prints ‚Äúbar‚Äù and when called with ‚Äúbar‚Äù prints ‚Äúfoo‚Äù. Every other option should print ‚ÄúTry 
again‚Äù?
18. Tell all the scenarios too implement the security in Kubernetes.
19. Your EKS application is experiencing higher than expected traffic. How would you automatically scale the Pods?
20. Your team needs to be alerted when the CPU usage of any Pod in your EKS cluster exceeds 80% for more than 5 minutes. How would you set this up?
21. Your team wants a Grafana dashboard to visualize the HTTP request latency of your applications running in EKS. How would you achieve this?
