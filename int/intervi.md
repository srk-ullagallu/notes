# Roles and Responsibilites or Day-To-Day activities
As a DevOps Engineer, my role focused on optimizing the development lifecycle and managing cloud infrastructure. On a daily basis, I was responsible for maintaining and improving CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, automating infrastructure with Terraform, and managing containerized environments using Docker and Kubernetes. I used AWS services like EC2, RDS, and CloudWatch to ensure seamless deployments and system stability. I also worked closely with developers and QA teams to troubleshoot production issues and improve the overall deployment process. One of my key achievements was implementing automated monitoring that reduced system downtime by 20%
# What could be the reason for job change

"I'm seeking a job change because I'm eager to take on new challenges and expand my expertise in DevOps, especially in areas like cloud automation and large-scale infrastructure management. While my current role has provided valuable experience, I’m excited about the opportunity your company offers to work on innovative projects and contribute in a more impactful way."

# Why you have career gap

After graduating, I moved to Hyderabad with a clear vision of becoming a Java Developer.

"I dedicated considerable time to mastering Java, driven by the goal of establishing a strong foundation in software development."

However, I faced challenges early on, as many interviews were either rejected or not scheduled due to my academic percentage.

In 2016, life took an unexpected turn when my father met with a serious accident, and I had to return home to manage our family’s paddy business.

This period not only taught me resilience and responsibility but also allowed me to develop a strong sense of adaptability in the face of difficult situations.

By mid-2018, I reignited my passion for the software industry and shifted my focus to DevOps, a field that was booming at the time. 

My background in Java became an invaluable asset as it helped me understand how different components, like the frontend, backend, and database, communicate within an application.


"This experience has shaped my ability to approach DevOps from a developer's perspective, allowing me to create more efficient solutions that seamlessly integrate development and operations."

# Why we hire you

You should hire me because I bring a unique combination of experience in both development and DevOps. My expertise in AWS, Jenkins, and Docker, along with my background in Java, enables me to design better solutions that bridge the gap between development and operations. I'm proactive in solving challenges and have a proven track record of improving efficiency and streamlining processes. Additionally, I'm passionate about staying updated on industry trends, and I believe I can make a significant contribution to your team and help drive the company forward
