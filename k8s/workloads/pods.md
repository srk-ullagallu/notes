### **Pods**  
- A **Pod** is the **smallest, deployable unit** in Kubernetes.  
- It represents a **single instance** of an application or a group of tightly coupled containers that share the same network and storage.  
- Containers in a pod share the **same IP address** and **storage volumes**.  
- Pods are **ephemeral** by default, meaning they are not long-lived and can be recreated by controllers like Deployments or StatefulSets.  

---

### **Key Points**  
- A Pod can **contain one or more containers**.  
- Containers within a Pod share the same **network namespace**, allowing communication using `localhost`.  
- Pods can have **storage volumes** attached to them for data persistence.  
- Kubernetes **manages pods** to ensure applications are running as expected.

### **Pod Lifecycle**  

1. **Pending**: Pod is accepted by the Kubernetes API but is waiting for the resources to be allocated.  
2. **Running**: Pod has been scheduled to a node, and at least one container is running.  
3. **Succeeded**: All containers in the pod have terminated successfully, and it will not be restarted.  
4. **Failed**: At least one container terminated unexpectedly, and the pod is marked as failed.  
5. **Unknown**: The state of the pod cannot be determined due to a communication error.

### **Pod Phases & Example**  
- View the status of a Pod:  
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```  
   **Example Output**:  
   ```plaintext
   NAME       READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE  
   my-pod     1/1     Running     0          5m  
   my-pod2    0/1     Pending     0          1m  
   my-pod3    0/1     Failed      2          10m  
   ```

### **Pod Distribution (Pod Anti-Affinity and Affinity)**  
Kubernetes allows for scheduling pods intelligently using **affinity** and **anti-affinity** rules.

1. **Node Affinity**: Schedule pods based on node labels.  
   ```yaml
   affinity:
     nodeAffinity:
       requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
         nodeSelectorTerms:
           - matchExpressions:
               - key: zone
                 operator: In
                 values:
                   - us-east-1a
   ```

2. **Pod Affinity**: Place pods **near** specific pods.  
   ```yaml
   affinity:
     podAffinity:
       requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
         - labelSelector:
             matchExpressions:
               - key: app
                 operator: In
                 values:
                   - frontend
           topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
   ```

3. **Pod Anti-Affinity**: Spread pods **across nodes** to avoid co-location.  
   ```yaml
   affinity:
     podAntiAffinity:
       requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
         - labelSelector:
             matchExpressions:
               - key: app
                 operator: In
                 values:
                   - frontend
           topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
   ```

### **Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB)**  
- **Pod Disruption Budgets** (PDB) are used to **limit voluntary disruptions** to pods.  
- They ensure that a minimum number of pods remain available during maintenance or updates.  

---

### **Key Points About PDB**  
- Define a **minimum available** or **maximum unavailable** pod count.  
- Prevents disruptions beyond the defined limits.  
- Useful for **stateful applications** or high-availability workloads.  

**Example**:  
```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: pdb-example
  namespace: dev
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
```
- Ensures at least **2 pods** with the `app=frontend` label remain available during disruptions.

Pods are at the **core** of Kubernetes, providing the building block for running containerized applications efficiently with features like scheduling rules, namespaces, and disruption budgets.
