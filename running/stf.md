### Before IAC
* Manully provision Infra leads some problems
* Time Consumung
* Error Prone
* No tracking history[Manually note down the what resources are created]
* No Scalability
### After IAC
* The first benefit of declararing Infra as a Code , we can versioning infra code and establishes more collaborative env and less configuration drift and scalable infra
* Fast the infra CURD
* Easy to replicate infra across different env maintain consistency
* It is to do cost analysis
### Terraform
* Terraform is one of the IAC tool
* It is a Cloud Agnostic[supports infra creation on multiple cloud providers]
* Maintains statefile to keep track the resources that are provisioned by terraform
### Terraform commands

1. **`init`**: Initializes the working directory containing Terraform configuration files. It prepares the backend (where Terraform stores state) and installs any required provider plugins.

2. **`validate`**: Validates the configuration files to ensure that the syntax is correct and references are valid. It doesn't check whether the configuration can be applied, just the basic structure.

3. **`plan`**: Creates an execution plan, showing the changes Terraform will make to the infrastructure. It helps to preview what will happen when you run `apply`.

4. **`apply`**: Executes the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, as outlined in the execution plan. This applies the changes to your infrastructure.

5. **`destroy`**: Deletes all the resources that Terraform manages, essentially tearing down the infrastructure.

6. **`show`**: Displays information about the current state of the infrastructure. This includes the resources that are managed by Terraform.

7. **`import`**: Allows existing infrastructure to be brought under Terraform management without making any changes. It imports the current state of a resource into the state file.

### Resource,Null,variable,output,local blocks

1. **`terraform {}`**:
   - This block is used to configure Terraform settings. It can define backend configuration (where the state is stored), required provider versions, and other settings related to Terraform's behavior.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     terraform {
       backend "s3" {
         bucket = "my-terraform-state"
         key    = "path/to/my/key"
         region = "us-west-2"
       }
       required_version = ">= 1.0.0"
     }
     ```

2. **`provider {}`**:
   - This block configures the providers that Terraform will use to manage infrastructure. Providers allow Terraform to interact with cloud services, APIs, etc.
   - Example (for AWS):
     ```hcl
     provider "aws" {
       region = "us-west-2"
     }
     ```

3. **`resource <resource_type> <resource_local_label> {}`**:
   - This block defines a resource that Terraform will manage. `<resource_type>` is the type of resource (like `aws_instance`, `aws_s3_bucket`), and `<resource_local_label>` is a unique name you give that resource for local reference.
   - Example (AWS EC2 instance):
     ```hcl
     resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
       ami           = "ami-123456"
       instance_type = "t2.micro"
     }
     ```

4. **`resource "null_resource" <resource_local_label> {}`**:
   - A `null_resource` is a Terraform resource that doesn't create anything by itself but can be used to trigger actions (e.g., running provisioners). It’s useful for managing side effects.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     resource "null_resource" "example" {
       triggers = {
         always_run = "${timestamp()}"
       }
     }
     ```

5. **`variable <variable-name> {}`**:
   - Defines an input variable for your Terraform configuration. Variables allow parameterization, making your Terraform code more reusable.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     variable "instance_type" {
       description = "Type of instance to use"
       type        = string
       default     = "t2.micro"
     }
     ```

6. **`output <output_name> {}`**:
   - This block defines an output value from the Terraform configuration. Outputs allow you to display or use specific data after resources are created or modified.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     output "instance_ip" {
       value = aws_instance.web_server.public_ip
     }
     ```

7. **`locals {}`**:
   - Defines local variables within a Terraform configuration. These are used for calculations or storing values that are reused within the configuration but are not meant to be inputs or outputs.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     locals {
       instance_name = "web_server"
     }
     ```
8. **Data Sources in Terraform**

A **`data`** block in Terraform allows you to **fetch data from existing infrastructure** or external systems that are not managed directly by your Terraform configuration. This is useful for referencing resources created outside of Terraform or querying APIs.

#### **Syntax**:
```hcl
data "<source_name>" "<local_ref_name>" {
  # configuration
}
```

- **`source_name`**: The type of data source (e.g., `aws_ami`, `aws_vpc`).
- **`local_ref_name`**: A name you assign to reference this data source within your configuration.

#### **Example**:
Fetching the latest AWS AMI for Ubuntu:
```hcl
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["099720109477"]  # Canonical owner ID for Ubuntu
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-bionic-18.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

#### **Use Cases**:
- Reference external resources (e.g., existing VPCs, security groups).
- Fetch dynamic values from APIs (e.g., latest AMI).
- Import configurations that aren't managed by Terraform directly.

### Loops,Conditions,Functions
Here’s an explanation of the looping constructs, conditional expressions, and functions you mentioned in **Terraform**:

---

### **Looping Constructs**

1. **`count`**:
   - The `count` parameter creates multiple instances of a resource based on a specified number. It’s commonly used to loop over simple numbers.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     resource "aws_instance" "web" {
       count = 3
       ami           = "ami-123456"
       instance_type = "t2.micro"
     }
     ```
     This creates 3 instances of `aws_instance.web`.

2. **`for_each`**:
   - `for_each` allows you to create resources based on the keys of a map or elements of a set/list. It’s more flexible than `count` for working with named resources.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     resource "aws_instance" "web" {
       for_each = { "web1" = "ami-123456", "web2" = "ami-789012" }
       ami           = each.value
       instance_type = "t2.micro"
     }
     ```
     This creates instances with different AMIs using the keys `web1` and `web2`.

3. **`dynamic`**:
   - The `dynamic` block allows you to generate nested blocks conditionally or programmatically inside a resource, using loops.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
       name = "example"

       dynamic "ingress" {
         for_each = var.rules
         content {
           from_port = ingress.value["from_port"]
           to_port   = ingress.value["to_port"]
           protocol  = ingress.value["protocol"]
           cidr_blocks = ingress.value["cidr_blocks"]
         }
       }
     }
     ```
     This dynamically generates ingress rules based on a variable `var.rules`.

### **Conditional Expressions**

- **`condition ? true_value : false_value`**:
   - Conditional expressions in Terraform allow you to choose between two values based on a condition, similar to the ternary operator in other programming languages.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     instance_type = var.env == "production" ? "m5.large" : "t2.micro"
     ```
     This assigns `m5.large` if the environment is production, otherwise `t2.micro`.



### **Functions**

1. **`split()`**:
   - Splits a string into a list based on a given delimiter.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     split(",", "a,b,c")  // ["a", "b", "c"]
     ```

2. **`lookup()`**:
   - Looks up a key in a map and returns its value. You can also specify a default value if the key is not found.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     lookup({ "a" = 1, "b" = 2 }, "a", 0)  // 1
     lookup({ "a" = 1, "b" = 2 }, "c", 0)  // 0
     ```

3. **`join()`**:
   - Joins the elements of a list into a string with a specified separator.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     join(", ", ["one", "two", "three"])  // "one, two, three"
     ```

4. **`element()`**:
   - Returns the element at a given index in a list.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     element(["a", "b", "c"], 1)  // "b"
     ```

5. **`length()`**:
   - Returns the number of elements in a list, map, or string.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     length(["a", "b", "c"])  // 3
     ```

6. **`file()`**:
   - Reads the contents of a file from a local path.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     file("config.json")  // returns the content of config.json
     ```

7. **`timestamp()`**:
   - Returns the current UTC timestamp in RFC 3339 format.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     timestamp()  // "2024-10-12T08:00:00Z"
     ```
### Local state,Remote state and Locking

#### **1. Local State**
   - Terraform by default stores the state of your infrastructure in a local file called `terraform.tfstate`. This file contains the current configuration of the resources that Terraform manages.

   **Disadvantages of Local State:**
   - **Lack of Collaboration**: If multiple team members are working on the same infrastructure, each person's state file will be local to their machine, leading to inconsistencies and potential overwrites.
   - **Risk of Data Loss**: Since the state is stored locally, there's a higher risk of losing the state file due to accidental deletion, file corruption, or local machine failure.
   - **Versioning and Auditing**: Local state doesn't have built-in versioning or change tracking, making it difficult to audit changes or roll back to previous states.
   - **Security**: Sensitive information like access keys or database passwords could be stored in the local state file. If the file is on a local machine, it may not be as secure as storing it in a managed backend.

#### **2. Remote State**
   - Remote state allows Terraform to store the state file in a remote location such as AWS S3, Terraform Cloud, or an HTTP backend. This enables better collaboration, data safety, and management.

   **Advantages of Remote State Over Local State:**
   - **Collaboration**: Remote state enables multiple users to share a single state file, allowing team members to collaborate on the same infrastructure without conflicts.
   - **Data Safety**: Storing the state remotely reduces the risk of data loss due to local machine failures. Cloud backends typically offer durability and redundancy.
   - **Versioning**: Many remote state backends (e.g., AWS S3 with versioning enabled) automatically track and save versions of your state file, allowing you to roll back to a previous version if necessary.
   - **State Locking**: Remote backends support **state locking**, which prevents multiple Terraform operations from modifying the state at the same time.

   **Disadvantages of Remote State:**
   - **Latency**: Operations like `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` may take slightly longer when fetching and updating remote state compared to local state, especially for large infrastructure setups.
   - **Complexity**: Remote state requires additional setup, such as configuring an S3 bucket, DynamoDB table (for locking), or using Terraform Cloud, which adds complexity compared to the default local state.
   - **Cost**: Depending on the remote backend (e.g., AWS S3, Terraform Cloud), there may be additional costs for storage, API requests, or managing state versions.

#### **3. Locking**
   - Locking ensures that only one `terraform apply` or `terraform plan` command can modify the state file at a time, preventing race conditions or conflicts that could lead to inconsistent state.
   - For example, in AWS, you can use a **DynamoDB table** along with an S3 bucket to lock the state file during operations.

   **Uses of Locking:**
   - **Prevents Concurrent Modifications**: When working with remote state, locking ensures that only one Terraform process can write to the state file at a time, preventing conflicts between multiple team members or CI/CD pipelines.
   - **Data Integrity**: Locking helps maintain the integrity of the state file by preventing simultaneous updates that could lead to inconsistent or corrupted state.
   - **Collaboration**: Locking ensures safe collaboration in team environments, where multiple users may attempt to modify infrastructure at the same time.
   
   **Disadvantages of Locking (if not used correctly):**
   - **Deadlock**: If a lock is not released (e.g., due to a failed operation or unexpected termination), it could result in a deadlock, preventing future Terraform operations from proceeding.
   - **Overhead**: There’s a small amount of operational overhead with setting up and managing locking mechanisms, such as using DynamoDB for lock management in AWS.

---

### **Summary of Remote State and Locking Advantages**
- **Remote State**:
  - Enables safe collaboration across teams.
  - Provides better security and reliability by storing state in managed storage services.
  - Supports versioning and rollback, reducing the risk of irreversible changes.

- **Locking**:
  - Prevents concurrent operations from corrupting the state file.
  - Ensures safe updates in team environments.
  - Reduces the chance of race conditions and inconsistencies in infrastructure management.

### Provisioners

### **Provisioners in Terraform**

Provisioners are used to execute scripts or commands on resources after they are created or modified. They are typically used for bootstrapping, configuration, or performing tasks that cannot be handled by resource-level properties.

#### **Types of Provisioners:**

1. **`local-exec`**:
   - Executes commands on the machine running Terraform (locally).
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     provisioner "local-exec" {
       command = "echo 'Instance created!'"
     }
     ```

2. **`remote-exec`**:
   - Executes commands on a remote resource via SSH or WinRM.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     provisioner "remote-exec" {
       inline = ["sudo apt-get update", "sudo apt-get install -y nginx"]
     }
     ```

3. **`file`**:
   - Transfers files or directories to a remote resource.
   - Example:
     ```hcl
     provisioner "file" {
       source      = "app.conf"
       destination = "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"
     }
     ```

#### **Provisioner Triggers:**

- **`on_failure`**: Specifies what happens when a provisioner fails (`continue` or `fail`).
- **`when`**: Can be set to `create`, `destroy`, or `both` to specify when the provisioner runs.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- Provisioners are not ideal for long-term use as they break the **declarative nature** of Terraform.
- **Dependency on external systems**: Introduces reliance on external services (SSH, WinRM) and may fail due to network or configuration issues.


### Effectively Handling Configuration Drift

**Configuration drift** occurs when the actual state of your infrastructure diverges from the desired state defined in your Terraform code. This can happen when resources are manually modified outside of Terraform. To handle and correct drift, you can use the following strategies:

#### **1. Regularly Run `terraform plan`**
   - **Purpose**: Detect any changes or drift in your infrastructure by comparing the current state to the desired configuration.
   - **How**: Run `terraform plan` regularly to identify discrepancies between the state file and actual infrastructure.
   - **Benefit**: Quickly identifies drift and shows potential changes before applying them.

#### **2. Use `terraform apply` to Fix Drift**
   - **Purpose**: Apply changes to bring your infrastructure back to the desired state.
   - **How**: After detecting drift with `terraform plan`, run `terraform apply` to automatically update the infrastructure to match the configuration.
   - **Benefit**: Ensures infrastructure consistency by enforcing the declared state.

#### **3. Automate with CI/CD**
   - **Purpose**: Automatically detect and handle drift.
   - **How**: Integrate `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` into your CI/CD pipelines for continuous monitoring and correction of drift.
   - **Benefit**: Reduces manual intervention and ensures drift is handled promptly.

#### **4. Use Remote State**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure accurate, up-to-date tracking of infrastructure state.
   - **How**: Store your state file remotely (e.g., in AWS S3) to keep it consistent across teams and avoid local changes that lead to drift.
   - **Benefit**: Improves state consistency and prevents conflicting changes.

#### **5. Implement Proper Access Controls**
   - **Purpose**: Limit manual changes to infrastructure.
   - **How**: Use strict IAM policies to control who can modify infrastructure outside Terraform.
   - **Benefit**: Reduces the chance of unintentional or unauthorized changes that cause drift.

#### **6. Monitor and Alert for Manual Changes**
   - **Purpose**: Detect and alert on manual infrastructure changes.
   - **How**: Use monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs) to track manual modifications.
   - **Benefit**: Provides visibility into changes made outside of Terraform and helps address them proactively.

#### **Summary**:
- **Detect drift** with `terraform plan`.
- **Fix drift** with `terraform apply`.
- **Automate drift detection** using CI/CD.
- **Prevent drift** by using remote state and controlling manual access.

### Terraform Cloud

### **Terraform Cloud**

Terraform Cloud is a managed service by HashiCorp that provides collaboration, governance, and automation features for Terraform users. It centralizes state management and simplifies workflows for teams.
