standard operating procedure

time spend in ops is very very huge cast compared to development cast

automation tested in dev easy to replicate scalable infra across different envs 

- Time to prodution faster
- Less Configuration drift[unkonwn things will not give surprises]
- Reduce cost[Engineeringcost+businesscost]

alternative to terraform[pulumi,crossplane[k8snativeinfraprovision tool]]

`Ansible` exclusively for configuation management[do automation inside os]
`Terraform` exclusively for creating consistent infrastrautre[network,storage,compute,db...]

`Pulumi` cames with a concept like to write infrastructure code no need to learn any DSL you can able to write any programmin lang that already comfort this is main behind it ofcourse terraform comes same thought to counter pulumi.
