### **Key Cloud and DevOps Terminologies**  

1. **IOPS** - Input/Output Operations Per Second, measures storage performance.  
2. **Throughput** - Amount of data transferred per second (MB/s).  
3. **Latency** - Delay in processing a request, measured in milliseconds.  
4. **High Availability** - Ensures minimal downtime by using redundant systems.  
5. **Scalability** - Ability to handle increased workload by scaling resources.  

### **Scaling Types**  
6. **Horizontal Scaling (Scale In & Scale Out)**  
   - Scale Out: Add more instances/servers.  
   - Scale In: Remove instances/servers.  

7. **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up & Scale Down)**  
   - Scale Up: Increase instance size (CPU, RAM).  
   - Scale Down: Decrease instance size.  

8. **Fault Tolerance** - System continues to work despite failures.  
9. **Failover** - Automatic switch to a backup system when failure occurs.  
10. **Redundancy** - Duplicate resources for reliability and backup.  
11. **Durability** - Ensures data persistence over time, even after failures.  
12. **Provisioning** - Allocating resources like compute, storage, or networking.  
13. **Deprovisioning** - Releasing or removing allocated resources.  
14. **Elasticity** - Automatically scaling resources up or down based on demand.  
15. **Load Balancing** - Distributing traffic across multiple resources to optimize performance.  
16. **Autoscaling** - Automatically adjusting the number of instances based on traffic.  
17. **Cold Start** - Delay when a resource (e.g., Lambda) initializes for the first time.  
18. **Warm Start** - Faster response as the resource is already initialized.  
19. **Consistency** - Ensuring data remains the same across distributed systems.  
20. **Eventual Consistency** - Data updates propagate over time in distributed systems.  
21. **Strong Consistency** - Data updates are immediately reflected across all nodes.  
22. **Observability** - Monitoring system health using logs, metrics, and traces.  
23. **Resiliency** - Ability to recover quickly from failures.  
24. **Data Replication** - Copying data across multiple locations for availability.  
25. **Data Integrity** - Ensuring accuracy and consistency of stored data.  
26. **Hot Standby** - A backup system that runs parallel and takes over immediately.  
27. **Cold Standby** - A backup system that is activated only when needed.  
28. **Immutable Infrastructure** - Resources are never modified after deployment; instead, they are replaced.  
29. **Blue-Green Deployment** - Running two environments (Blue & Green) to minimize downtime.  
30. **Canary Deployment** - Gradual rollout of a new version to a small subset of users before full deployment.  
31. **Rolling Deployment** - Updating instances gradually instead of all at once.
